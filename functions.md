# Functions
Functions are the main "building blocks" of the program. They allow teh code to be called many time without having to retype it multiple times.

## How functions work
### Function Declaration
To create a function, use a **function declaration**.

```
function showMessage(){
    alert("Quack!")
}
```

To call a function, you call it by its name.

```
showMessage()
```

So now it would **alert: Quack**.
