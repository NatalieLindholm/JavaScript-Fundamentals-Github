# Variables
Variables are used to store information.

## How variabels work
### Let
Let is a way to declare a variabel. A let value can be change.

```
let message
```

Here we are declaring a variabel with the name **message**. 

```
message = "Goose"
```

And here we are storing a string with **"Goose"** in the variabel.

```
let name = "Bonker"
```

Here we are combining the declaration and assignment.

### Var
**Var** is an old-school way to declare a variabel, almost the same as **let**. Not recommended to use.

```
var candy
```

### Changing data in a let variabel

```
let height

height = 25
```

Here we declared the variabel **height** with the value **25**.

```
height = 42
```

The value changed to **42**, the old data is removed.

```
alert(height)
```

It alert the height **42**.

### Const
Const is an unchangengable variabel (read only).

```
const myBirthday = "21.03.2003"
```

Here we declared the variabel **myBirthday**.

```
myBirthday = "28.11.1995"
```

When trying to change the value you will get an error: **can't reassign the constant!**,
