# Loops
Loops are used to repeat the same code multiple times.

## Different kinds of loops
### The "while" loop
Loops through a code while a specified condition is true

Here it alerts the **i** while its less then **3**.
```
let i = 0;
while (i < 3){
    alert(i)
    i++
}
```

So the ouput would be that it shows 0, then 1 , then 2.

The while loop can also work the other way
```
let i = 3;
 while (i) {
     alert(i)
     i--
}
```

So the ouput on this would be that it shows 3, then 2 , then 1.

### The "for" loop
Loops through a code a number of times

So here it alerts **i** while its less then **3** starting from **0**

```
 for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
     alert(i)
}
```

So the ouput on this would be that it shows 0, then 1 , then 2.
